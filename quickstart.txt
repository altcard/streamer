Install streamer (obv) and ruby (no libs needed rly):

$ sudo apt install streamer ruby rubygems -y

Configure the streaming tool by placing "config.json" next to "stream.rb":

$ cat >>config.json<<EOF
{ "interval": 0.5, "socket": false }
EOF

Available options for "config.json":
- "interval" (double) - the delay time between multiple cam shorts (in seconds)
- "socket" (false or path) - if false, it means you stop "stream.rb" with SIGINT (Ctrl+C) by yourself somehow
			     if path, then the specified file's lifetime (basically, the timespan before you delete it) is the time window when the program shall operate
- "source" (v4l device path) - v4l device path to use at the video input. By default, it's /dev/video0
- "fork" (true/false) - whether to fork the process or not. Valid only if "socket" is not false.

All shots overwrite each other and are saved at /tmp/cam.jpeg. Overriding this setting is possible, but is not recommended.

So, after config, run "stream.rb"

$ ruby stream.rb

If you need a primitive web frontend for this, you'll need python3 and a new terminal session, where you shall run "go.sh" from the "html" folder:

$ sh html/go.sh
